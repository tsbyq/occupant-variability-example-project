# Occupant-Variability Example Project

## Overview

This repository contains an Example Occupant Variability Project to test the usage of the 
OpenStudio-Occupant-Variability-Gem. Currently, this example project uses a detailed small office building
model to demonstrate the variability added by OpenStudio-Occupant-Variability-Gem.

The `Rakefile` includes Rake tasks to run add variabilities from `occupant`, `lighting`, `MELs`, `thermal preferences`, 
and `ventilation`, and the `run_all` Rake task to run all the tasks, simulations will run in the `run` directory.

## Usage

``` bundle install```

``` bundle update```

``` bundle exec rake```
